# Songs from the next day to this day


## Book one, in which we first meet Them


### Part one, in which "I" tells the facts

Now I have to tell that one thing, <br>
and show how it all starts and still <br>
I beg for Your spark and Your skill. <br>
This tale, let me know how to sing.

That was the place, or so it seems. <br>
"Look there, you shall find the last cause. <br>
There you shall read what is, what was, <br>
what will be. You shall see their dreams."

I sat, eyes closed, my breath took me, <br>
and my face went in to the light, <br>
my face was lost in to the white. <br>
In awe I asked how it could be.

I left my breath, my skin, my eyes. <br>
I still had my legs and my arms. <br>
Then I felt their souls and their harms, <br>
and, lone on the Earth, I was wise.

Since those facts a few years have passed, <br>
since then I have tried to find why. <br>
I have gone lone, stopped to go high, <br>
lone talked, in fact the list is vast.

When I tried to make its bark cease <br>
the mad dog brought me to the East. <br>
I hate this self of mine, this beast <br>
that lurks, barks and gives me no peace.

At night I would sit with my cheek <br>
on my fist. I would wait for You, <br>
one day they will do the same too. <br>
From me the kind love of the weak.

If I look back and think the way, <br>
I see that I have been in search <br>
of You, still am. Left in the lurch, <br>
I ask what was that made me stray.

It was that land or sea, that soul, <br>
where I saw You smile, where I saw <br>
a kid with Your eyes and his awe. <br>
There a girl with Your hands that stole

Thoughts, fast as the throw of a dart, <br>
men with Your smile that let me rest. <br>
And each time I slept on the chest <br>
of the night, 'cause she had Your heart.

And I know it was You that girl <br>
on sale, to whom I once told all <br>
this tale, while she looked at my fall. <br>
"Hear if you want," she held her pearl,

"Thoughts will rise, void words from a dark <br>
place where they live, they'll make you fight. <br>
Lift the cloth and they'll see the light, <br>
like flies from meat you'll see them spark."

The lil girl winked in her heeled shoes, <br>
and smiled from the back of a guy. <br>
Soon I had to wish them good bye, <br>
so soon they went. I had no clues.

While I look at the world, I hope <br>
that You are here. When I will find <br>
You, and feel Your touch on my mind, <br>
I will no more go down that slope,

Where in search of You I did choke. <br>
With You I will have back my breath. <br>
Or I will not find You and death <br>
will be here now with her black cloak,

The dark night with no stars nor skies. <br>
I will watch her face and not Yours, <br>
I will kiss her lips and not Yours, <br>
and I will see You in her eyes.

_"My face was lost in to the white."_



### Part two, in which She first calls me

It had to be in long lost dreams <br>
that She first called me from my bed. <br>
Then Her voice was first in my head <br>
and cut that thick fog at the seams.

That night She was a new born child, <br>
light, soft, and in Her eyes a shine. <br>
I hugged Her as if She were mine, <br>
I held Her in my arms, She smiled.

In the midst of light and dark thoughts, <br>
of sleep and wake, I heard Her voice. <br>
She told me that I was Her choice, <br>
She asked me to tie those bags' knots.

Who was She, this bolt from the sky, <br>
this cute bird in a nest of swords. <br>
"If you can say it in mere words, <br>
when you want to, then it's a lie."

She laughed at Her joke, while She played <br>
on the floor with my gold and stones. <br>
Her game gave me chills in the bones: <br>
maps of moods and feels She had made.

Once She was a doll with black hair, <br>
She was made of red blue green gum. <br>
She was not a friend, from my thumb <br>
She stole the ring, or was it fair.

Once She sent Her four slaves to trick, <br>
then the view was odd strange and fake, <br>
their punch left my paunch to ache. <br>
She a pale nymph or a simple chick.

For long I knew it was Her smile <br>
when She had gone back to Her place. <br>
She is a voice, She is a face, <br>
a thought, She is the queen of guile.

She is a feel, She is that song <br>
in your mind, She is that sweet fiddle. <br>
'Cause to me She is still a riddle, <br>
for Her I can't tell right from wrong.

What did She do to make me cringe, <br>
do what She asked, be with no wife, <br>
feel I would loose Her, tell my life. <br>
She did use my bod's urge to binge.

Like a full moon at noon She haunts: <br>
"Write. Each time you'll do it for Me <br>
and I'll have a new face for thee." <br>
She gives what She wants when She wants.

I want Her game and tell Her so. <br>
"Go up the hill, up stream the creek." <br>
She says. "It'll be yours on the peak." <br>
I pawn my ring and there I go.

Now She is in my dreams once more. <br>
There She cries for Her man has gone, <br>
and weeps on me, it must be dawn. <br>
Her rain hugs me, where is the shore.

This night She tells me what to write. <br>
This is Her tale, tale of Their lives. <br>
I feel shame while I tell these lies, <br>
'cause I feel I can't do it right.

In Her words: "Your lives are just dots, <br>
now you'll find the cause of this day <br>
in to the next day." "Who are They." <br>
"They are the key to clear those knots."

"Just as if They were you and I, <br>
ask who is you and who is I, <br>
what you wants, and the same for I. <br>
You knows what I means, so do I."

_"Once She sent Her four slaves to trick."_



### Part three, in which She and He meet

She rose. The cracks were heard for years, <br>
vast and mute She rose from Her soles, <br>
the Gods' gift, the ruin of the souls. <br>
There on Earth they weeped and shed tears.

The sky fell on Earth, it was night. <br>
Some didn't know what hit, all was blurred, <br>
and they were gone with out a word. <br>
There She was queen with out a fight.

He sat and asked and prayed and thought: <br>
"She is my drug, She is my light, <br>
She is my bug, She is my blight. <br>
Give Her the words." For Her He fought.

They called Him life, She called Him death. <br>
She broke His right heart with Her foot, <br>
but it's good that She had no boot. <br>
Now He could not bless nor have breath.

Then She moved Her hands in a dance: <br>
"No way to break the chain my friend, <br>
no one can win up at the end." <br>
She made Him drop that one last chance.

Her words closed the gates of His mind. <br>
Stuck in a rut, sand in the eyes, <br>
He looked at Her through stacks of skies. <br>
Her words had once more made him blind.

She told the four slaves where He was. <br>
She could craft their world with Her words, <br>
in that cage they were bound like birds. <br>
"You shall go and take with your jaws."

The imp said: "Please tell us the truth." <br>
"Good stuff floats, and the waste goes down <br>
to the place where you feed and frown," <br>
said the Queen that knows age and youth.

"Right where you did meet in the past, <br>
near the pink creek to the green lake." <br>
First was the dog, got next the snake, <br>
third was the man; the imp went last.

The imp was on Him first and took <br>
His prime mind and His prime first skin, <br>
'cause those were the keys to get in <br>
Her, how He could still feel and look.

"Now the man will eat you and go," <br>
Said the snake, yet He felt no fear. <br>
"Wait for one year, and still be here, <br>
the snake will stay, with sun or snow."

Said the man and they both bit Him. <br>
His first and last thought of the day, <br>
and His first and last breath till May, <br>
were in their jaws and He looked grim.

The dog took His last flesh and bones. <br>
"This is a test, you shall be Mine." <br>
Then to the slaves: "That's how you dine." <br>
And then She dressed Him in cold stones.

She told the dog to kiss Her feet, <br>
She told the snake to stroke Her leg, <br>
She told the man for Her to beg, <br>
She gave the imp Her dirt to eat.

There He was, proof of ruin and wrack. <br>
He faced the skies, and asked for more. <br>
So many stars and He saw a door, <br>
that door, and so He was healed back.

This tale was and once more will be, <br>
'cause Time is round and still goes round. <br>
Each turn is a stance of what's bound, <br>
our face whirls down in to that sea. <br>



<img src="svg/book1-part3.svg" width="500" />

_"Vast and mute She rose from Her soles."_



### Part four, in which we hear His rants

There on Mars, lots of strange men there. <br>
It's hard to hear: "Let's take a train," <br>
They watch me flip: "Let's leave this plain." <br>
They touch my lip. Where is the air.

He was born there, He was born right, <br>
yet They think that He is from space. <br>
He's like no one else in that place, <br>
and on all days He has the right.

He is a fool, and a mad man. <br>
He is so strange in His own place, <br>
so lone, He'll leave with out a trace <br>
when He'll cross the line of the ban.

"If He's at your door, give Him gold. <br>
His dad a tall old girl from Mars." <br>
That is what I learned in those bars <br>
late at night. That's what I was told.

So I did, and now I am beat. <br>
He walks with me in the red dirt, <br>
He grabs and pulls me by my shirt, <br>
He turns and we cross the street.

Each step a fall: "It's too much toil." <br>
I stop. "Hook Hers a butt o' death." <br>
"Who cares 'bout that" means His strange breath. <br>
"You My li'l beach I will not spoil."

Then He leaves me half way, with cars <br>
on both sides: "Guess how long to wait, <br>
run here or walk, judge at which rate. <br>
Or stay there and look at the stars."

He says: "Do not close that book yet, <br>
You have to love this film you live, <br>
that line from birth to death They give. <br>
You think you can still place your bet,"

"While you dream that there is a choice, <br>
while you dream that there is a deed. <br>
Calm peace of the world, that's your need." <br>
So that is the sound of His voice.

"Be mute and give your ear to Me. <br>
Some call it Fate. Some think they can <br>
choose how to play, they have a plan. <br>
Or choose the dealt hand, they've a key."

"Some know now what they should have done, <br>
and they soul is filled with that pain. <br>
In the same day they gloat in vain, <br>
death in their heart, they search for fun."

"In fact you know there's but one way, <br>
and you're in it, so in a sense <br>
it's your way, why to be so tense. <br>
Dance through the fog, how could you stray."

"I can tell that you will be more <br>
than you used to be at your peak, <br>
and you'll have eyes and hands that speak, <br>
when you'll know it's Us at your core."

Cars speed, then the roar of a truck. <br>
His voice on the noise, He's at ease. <br>
I stop Him and say: "Help me, please. <br>
How should I cross this road. I'm stuck."

"I don't know who 'I' has to be. <br>
I am no more the one I was. <br>
I was not who I thought I was." <br>
He says: "Sure, but now I've to pee."

Tick tack tick tack tick, who is It, <br>
tack tick tack tick, It is the one, <br>
tack tick tack, It is the lone sun, <br>
tick tack, that rose from the black pit.

_"He is a fool, and a mad man."_





## Book two, in which the next day shows



### Part one, in which we see a glimpse

What's in it for me, should I cease <br>
to write these songs or write them more. <br>
When my mind is lost in its war,  <br>
my next self sends a note of peace.

I can use it to find my way. <br>
Then there's the cost of a good deed, <br>
so I write it for all to read,  <br>
and see a glimpse of the next day.

I look in to the glass, at times, <br>
see some thing I didn't think I'd see, <br>
at once sense I knew there It'd be, <br>
and feel I've to tell that in rhymes.

That is the glass door of the soul, <br>
where all gods and sprites live and thrive. <br>
Those same that made me give and strive, <br>
those same that'll make me full and whole.

Please let all past forms and views pass. <br>
Please meet Them here. First light of dawn,  <br>
Their forms and Their views will be drawn. <br>
On this page the soul through the glass.

First we have to meet a new god. <br>
It hides so deep that we might take <br>
It for a sprite. Guess what's Its make. <br>
When we'll first see It, we'll be awed.

That is It. With a blond hair bob, <br>
It flaunts Its self in a pier glass, <br>
and with a smile It shows Its sass. <br>
It has such nice looks, a heart throb.

It says: "Thou art by cause of Them. <br>
They dream of thee. Thus thou wast sworn. <br>
Now They be here. Soon in the morn. <br>
When thou wake Them. Then thou be'st Them."

"You can't go to the gym next year. <br>
You can't make plans, or leave the strife, <br>
or change that thing, or change your life. <br>
Change your self and the world, my dear."

"You'll eat the head of a live snake, <br>
with bread, bit by bit. Feel the hate, <br>
bad taste, and fright, of such a plate. <br>
It will gross you out, but not break."

When It's here, It takes all the space. <br>
"Fais ce que tu doit que pour Moi, <br>
Parce que, en fait, Je suis ton roi." <br>
It's my king, I should ask for grace.

What It wants, can and must are one <br>
and the same thing, It has no laws. <br>
"I'm the kid you wish you had, 'cause <br>
your ex didn't want your girl or son."

It's in front of me in the glass, <br>
so I turn 'round and say to Them: <br>
"Look how nice I am, I'm a gem." <br>
It wears a wife's make up with class.

"Lei: è già qui, e Lui: è qua." <br>
It says: "Non è ciò che si fa, <br>
ciò che non è, ciò che non ha, <br>
ché il re del sud non ci sta."

He, She, and It show me the riddle, <br>
the crux, what it does mean and why, <br>
how to solve it. In fact I try, <br>
but it's hard to be in the middle.

They say: "One: good friend. Two: kind mate." <br>
Then: "Three: dear love." Please count past three, <br>
and add more terms to this list key. <br>
For Her: "Dog, snake, man." Then "imp" state.



<img src="svg/book2-part1.svg" width="500" />

_"You'll eat the head of a live snake."_



### Part two, in which She loves Him back

First, the ones that write these songs want <br>
to say a few words on the songs. <br>
Let them say this: "These are pop songs. <br>
One can get it now, with out taunt,

Or, well, get it on the next day. <br>
Feels from the streets, films and shows give <br>
the scent of pop, up through a sieve." <br>
Now let us go back to our play.

Now He and She are here each day. <br>
They are here more and more, by night <br>
and day, in the dreams that I write, <br>
in the streets, a face in my way.

Let's go to the hill of the dreams. <br>
If we look down in to the rocks, <br>
in the midst of all the stone blocks, <br>
there we will find some clean hot streams.

In to the hill rocks, from the Earth, <br>
Her wet stuff and His hot stuff force <br>
their way through the stones. From a source <br>
of pink broth, a creek has its birth.

It'll go to the lake, then the sea. <br>
There are pink hot tubs down the hill, <br>
they are there for the creek to fill. <br>
To this place She and He brought me.

From His mouth a long click click sound. <br>
He moved like a wave, in a dance. <br>
She was quiet and still, in a trance. <br>
He bate Her neck, Her bod He bound,

and held Her down with a soft squeak. <br>
He felt Her skin, She felt His kiss. <br>
His tail round Hers. Joined in a bliss, <br>
two skinks on a log near the creek.

He thought of Her, She thought of Him. <br>
At night in the house near the creek, <br>
She looked at Him, He touched Her cheek. <br>
She had black skin that shone, was slim.

I'm in awe while I look at Her <br>
trough His eyes and feel His feels. <br>
She smiled and took off Her white heels. <br>
She was so fine – I feel the stir

Of my heart – so cute, hot and kind, <br>
that She seemed to be from the sky.  <br>
He pulled Her close – I feel Her thigh. <br>
He held Her – A fire in my mind,

I feel with His hand Her light dress, <br>
and the thews of her arched back.  <br>
She kissed Him, as in a film, black <br>
and white, and then She just said: "Yes."

She wants me to hear Her love screams <br>
while She is with Him. Oh, how dear, <br>
how much gold it does cost to hear. <br>
That's how She and He haunt my dreams.

Out on the plain, of course, the rain, <br>
'cause She wished to merge with His heart. <br>
Now, that is too much on my part, <br>
the spice goes to my blood and brain,

I feel the end of life, the gloom <br>
of a fall in the void, and death. <br>
I think: "No." Now, I catch my breath, <br>
I'm out of Him, back to my tomb.

I ask to my self where It was. <br>
I know that It was there. It hides, <br>
lurks and stalks. It stays on the sides, <br>
in to the acts with out a cause.



<img src="svg/book2-part2.svg" width="500" />

_"He thought of Her, She thought of Him."_



### Part three, in which we see the World

Those that write want to be more in <br>
this tale, so let them say some thing: <br>
"You think you know how these words ring, <br>
the tongue of this script, you read with a grin."

"All this is for the eye that sees. <br>
So if we write: 'Oh my love, bye.' <br>
And next we add: 'My love bye bye.' <br>
If you are so kind to read, please,"

"Just look at the word length, look twice. <br>
If that is bad rhythm, then we doubt <br>
it is what you think. Here's the 'trout': <br>
The rhythm is from the Land of Rice."

Thus they want to make their first sale. <br>
Be that as it may, stop the spiel <br>
of those who write, they'll have their meal. <br>
We want to go on with our tale.

There is, on the back of the hill, <br>
a chasm that leads to a large pit: <br>
a huge hole in the ground, that's it. <br>
That day the air was cold and chill.

This hole in the ground is soft black, <br>
with brown and blue. I felt Its call <br>
to the depths, to the end less fall. <br>
There It was, a boy near the crack.

The boy said: "I rose from the hole," <br>
Its charms dared me to take a leap. <br>
I looked down in to the dark deep, <br>
to see the real shape of the soul,

And could not see the ground. I felt <br>
the pull of the void, saw Her, Him, <br>
and Them. They wished to know my whim, <br>
how I'd play the hand that was dealt,

If I could stand. They were 'round me  <br>
in a ring, They had turned Their backs.  <br>
The boy said: "Know what your mind lacks." <br>
"Your life is a ring, what will be"

"Is the cause of what is," It said. <br>
"On your soul They will leave a mark, <br>
then They'll fuck off back to the dark <br>
of the pit." Its voice in my head:

"If you now look at your In World, <br>
you think that there is an Out World, <br>
you think there are two worlds: In World, <br>
Out World. In fact it's the Same World."

"Call In World the cause of your feels, <br>
Out World the cause of what you sense. <br>
If you could just jump the fence, <br>
if you could just break the seals,"

"You think you would know those Worlds' laws. <br>
You look at a shade, and you make <br>
a source in your mind. That's a fake. <br>
Shades are but shades with out a cause."

"The Same World is but a pale shade, <br>
but a thin film that can't be seen <br>
by you. What you think is a screen, <br>
that is how the Same World is made."

"Now cut down the tale of the cave <br>
with an axe: you see, all in all, <br>
the World is the shade on the wall, <br>
with out cave, wall, sun, forms, or slave."

"In that World there is just one man, <br>
that man can have more than one face. <br>
With this in mind, look at that place: <br>
there is no end to what you can."



<img src="svg/book2-part3.svg" width="500" />

_"The boy said: 'I rose from the hole.'"_



### Part four, in which we meet the snake

Down the pink creek, past the green lake, <br>
near the sea, there's one of the towns. <br>
Full of dust and scents, folks and clowns, <br>
joy and pain, all for Her to take.

All that a soul may want or dread <br>
is there. She knows what a soul craves: <br>
in that town I can find Her slaves, <br>
and ask 'bout the lives they have led.

She had sent Her slaves to teach me <br>
when I first met them. They had showed <br>
in a fake world on a strange road. <br>
The dog held me, the snake punched me.

The girl friend from the sky was there. <br>
She showed a kind calm smile with ease, <br>
I saw Her and fell on my knees. <br>
Now, back where Her slaves say their prayer.

With its dumb smile and its strange hat, <br>
'round that town I can meet the dog, <br>
called as well Sir Bitch or the hog. <br>
Now Sir Bitch thinks I'm Her floor mat.

Once I was on a bus with boys <br>
and girls from the land South of Laos. <br>
The bus stopped in front of a house, <br>
they went down with a lot of noise.

There I saw the snake, a round gnome, <br>
a nice old man with a short tail, <br>
a little hair on it, its skin pale. <br>
The snake took the stairs and went home.

To know 'bout the snake's life and task, <br>
I went to the door step and rang <br>
the bell. I heard its long loud clang. <br>
Snake let me in. I had to ask:

"Why Her." "I don't know, I'm Her slave. <br>
I know I like to think of Her <br>
that sits on my face and moves Her <br>
hips. Day and night that's what I crave."

"I am just a lewd bald fat guy, <br>
and I'd like to please my self in <br>
my back, with a toy made of tin, <br>
while on Her forms I'd try to spy."

"But here's the thing that makes me mad: <br>
I think the dog had more of Her <br>
than me. That's how it lost its fur. <br>
I'm too shrewd for the game She had."

The snake went on: "But now I'm skint." <br>
Then: "It's called Sir Bitch, has no grace. <br>
It drank Her broth, wants on its face, <br>
from Her source, if you got my hint."

I had asked 'why' 'cause I know that's <br>
what all boys and girls want to know. <br>
That was a lot though, I thought: "Whoa, <br>
the snake did eat a lot of rats."

I know, I know, those who write <br>
want to say this: "What's this mind slough, <br>
why did we have to write this stuff. <br>
Why should we care 'bout their vile spite."

"Why did we have to ruin this tale. <br>
Please, talk some sense in to the snake,<br>
change those words, you know what's at stake."<br>
Now I have to end that sad wail.

That's Their tale, They tell where to look. <br>
How could I make sense of this stuff, <br>
or know why the tale got so rough. <br>
I hope They'll tell in the next book.


<img src="svg/book2-part4.svg" width="500" />

_"The snake took the stairs and went home."_





## Book three, in which we just chill out



### Part one, in which we have a chat


"These are signs and dreams of the next day. <br>
With these songs They will make the world. <br>
These words line the times that were curled. <br>
You should know your part in this play."

"Should see the fine lines that were curled. <br>
You'll know when you'll love part and play. <br>
Then you'll know 'bout your next day. <br>
And you'll see the fall of the world."

So I can talk to Them, that's strange, <br>
strange that They want to talk with me. <br>
It, He, She, They all heard my plea. <br>
I ask my self if that will change,

ask what They will want from me now. <br>
Now to me She is nice and kind, <br>
like a soft spring breeze on my mind. <br>
"You can cross a street, you know how."

She says, for He left me mid way, <br>
once on Mars, while He crossed a road, <br>
'cause He thought that His walk I slowed. <br>
At the end I did cross that day.

She is so good and sweet to me. <br>
She's like the taste of that gold fruit, <br>
She's like the sound of an elf flute. <br>
'Cause of some spell, She heard my plea.

Now She smiles: "Fine, let's play your game," <br>
She says. I say: "夫人, thank you <br>
for your help." So if I feel blue <br>
I can tell Her that with no shame.

I know that She gave me that choice: <br>
when I fall, I tell Her. She'll wink. <br>
Now it's His turn to speak, I think <br>
He likes the sound of His own voice.

"I know you had ten years to fall, <br>
you lived in the past with out aim. <br>
And then ten years to mourn in shame, <br>
that was not a dance or a ball."

"You knew change isn't a piece of cake, <br>
it is not a walk in the park, <br>
a show of pomp. It is a dark <br>
path full of woe, it is a wake."

"Change of the world is a raw gore. <br>
You have to part from the old self, <br>
you can't just put it on the shelf. <br>
That self is slain and is no more."

She and He give sense to the path. <br>
I don't know if I can tell Him <br>
'bout my falls, 'cause He will get grim, <br>
so I would see His scorn or wrath.

He would say that life is a fall <br>
to the death, a rule He can't bend. <br>
That I'll lose and die at the end. <br>
But when I fall He sees me crawl.

"Of course it was such a hard chore, <br>
and all folks know that, man, no doubt. <br>
But now you've got to chill out, <br>
you can't still be such a huge bore."

"You tried all things to stop the fall. <br>
You fell, now you fly with your wit. <br>
Real fall waits for you in the pit: <br>
at its end the woe, the hard wall."

"So now you can cry for that fall, <br>
fore see your ruin your life your mess <br>
with a mind full of strife and stress. <br>
But know that the pit got Them all."

_"You can't still be such a huge bore."_



### Part two, in which we talk 'bout signs


It says: "Once you looked at His hands, <br>
and He made the sign with three sides, <br>
that means the girl's deep eye that hides. <br>
So you searched for girls on all lands."

"And for a while you did feel cool. <br>
But that search left you void and dry, <br>
'cause to each girl you had to lie. <br>
Each girl was a hand, or a tool."

It says: "You went to Him to ask: <br>
'老師, please tell me what to do.' <br>
'There's a wall to paint,' He told you, <br>
'So for now that will be your task.'"

"You went there and put some paint <br>
on that wall. 'That is the wrong shade. <br>
So, as it was it should have stayed,' <br>
He said: 'Now take off all that paint.'"

"So you scraped the paint off the wall, <br>
went back, and asked: '老師, what now.' <br>
He laughed: 'So you look for the tao. <br>
First you have to look at the wall.'"

"'For how long.' Now His voice was staid: <br>
'You have to look at it for real. <br>
Just know that the first step is zeal: <br>
you stop when you know the right shade.'"

"You stared at the wall for ten years. <br>
For ten long years you looked and thought <br>
'bout that wall, 'bout each crack and dot. <br>
Some days you felt well, some in tears,"

"Some days you would think: 'I know now,' <br>
'cause you knew each small bulge and glow. <br>
Then you would think: 'I do not know.' <br>
And one day you knew why and how."

"That day you went to Him and said: <br>
'老師, now I know the right shade.' <br>
'很好, that first step you have made. <br>
Go live your life, or go to bed.'"

"'For now you can let the wall be.' <br>
He said. And you: 'But now I want <br>
to paint the wall.' 'Right. If you want, <br>
go paint the wall, and let Me be.'"

"You did paint the wall, and liked it. <br>
You asked the folks, and they liked it. <br>
So you asked Him if the shade fit. <br>
He said: 'You should learn when to quit.'"

"'But the folks like the wall now, so <br>
what's next.' He said 'Now you take down <br>
that damn wall for real, sort of a clown.' <br>
You took down the wall with the blow"

"of a club, or it is still there <br>
as a sign that you can paint walls, <br>
as a place where you cry your falls, <br>
and you can still go there and stare."

It says: "You still think of the art <br>
of the things, that some folks called 'signs.' <br>
Why you still think 'bout those ink lines. <br>
Now she is dead, they killed her heart."

"You mourn for the art of the things. <br>
It will be a tale for kids then, <br>
like those of the gods, of the men. <br>
Why do you cry for your lost strings."

"Now when folks look back they just say: <br>
'It was right back then that she died.' <br>
Right when the new goal was to hide, <br>
the new rule to stop those who stray."



### Part three, in which we think of You


They say You are not real, not true. <br>
In some sense, me too, I lost hope. <br>
Your signs are all I get to cope. <br>
It would be nice to talk to You.

Once I met a cute girl for sale <br>
and she said: "I know you want me." <br>
I said: "With you, how could it be. <br>
Then I will want to lift your veil"

"And kiss you in front of the priest, <br>
and say: 'With you for all my life, <br>
I do want you to be my wife,' <br>
and dance with you at the feast."

"I can't sleep with you. If I stay <br>
with you once, then I'll want to stay <br>
with you all nights. I'll want a way <br>
to be yours, I was made that way."

She thought it was a joke, she laughed. <br>
"Babe, just for a small piece of gold <br>
for you I can be what I'm told <br>
to be. So let me show my craft."

Then she said "I will be your wife". <br>
I thought she was a sign from You, <br>
sent to let me know what to do. <br>
So we talked of my times of strife.

"You'll want me more, the more you talk. <br>
Lie down, rest you head on my lap. <br>
If you want you can take a nap, <br>
just know that I am on the clock."

I loved her curves, her grace, her poise, <br>
the way she touched her neck lace beads. <br>
So I bragged of my feats and deeds, <br>
I told Her all my griefs and joys.

I told her how much I liked her, <br>
how nice she was. She heard me out, <br>
with a blank face, with out a doubt. <br>
Then she smiled and said: "Thank you, sir."

"Now time's up, do you have more gold." <br>
"Fair dame, that was my last gold, please <br>
can I talk with you with out fees, <br>
can I be with you, let's grow old."

"Babe, you know you can't be with me <br>
with out fee, you think with your groin. <br>
But if you want I'll choose the coin, <br>
I'll make you feel pain, that's my fee."

"I'll give you pain up to a point, <br>
up to the load that you can stand. <br>
Then a lil more. Give me your hand, <br>
thus I'll be your wife in this joint."

I thought I'd lose her, so I said: <br>
"I want that." "Pain will write my name <br>
on your soul for good. Like a flame <br>
it will brand you. Thus we'll be wed."

"Now I'll go sleep with my boy friend." <br>
A void at my tum. "See, you cling. <br>
You are not yet fit for this thing." <br>
She said. "So, for now that's the end."

"You'll lift the veil and see the source <br>
of all thoughts and feels, 'cause of me. <br>
Folks will call you mad, they won't see <br>
what you saw. That will be your force."

So they walked, her carved legs, her heels. <br>
He had a nice smile, the right guy, <br>
he shook my hand and said good bye. <br>
Did You send her to test my feels.

<img src="svg/book3-part3.svg" width="500" />

_"Once I met a cute girl for sale."_


### Part four, in which we see the beast


Now I see You, I see Your mind, <br>
when I look back to my ten years <br>
of shame. I was frail, full of fears <br>
and grief, a snow flake of a kind.

I thought that to fail is to end. <br>
So you sent a guy with its lust. <br>
It said it liked me, I could trust <br>
that in me it had found a friend.

I was lone and I had to feel good, <br>
so for a while I talked to it. <br>
I saw some red flags, I tried to quit, <br>
while I was as kind as I could.

It could not take a no from me, <br>
'cause I'm haute, a sylph, a nymph, but <br>
I'm low, I'm a hole, a whore slut. <br>
I am what it needs to break free.

"It will have me or it'll break me, <br>
it will bring more shame to my kin." <br>
I felt its eyes crawl on my skin, <br>
and more mad thoughts got in to me.

It says: "Don't give your ear to those <br>
that say that you would hurt a femme, <br>
'cause they want you to kill for them, <br>
they want to keep you on your toes."

It says: "Of course you know you could <br>
take a life, if you had lost hope. <br>
'Cause they take all your ways to cope, <br>
so they say that you are not good."

"'Cause they force you to feed the beast. <br>
You don't know how to handle the rage, <br>
but you must keep it in the cage. <br>
So at the end you are the beast."

"But if lost you'd first end your life, <br>
then a man's life, then a girl's life, <br>
a kid's. First on your throat the knife. <br>
You can find that the stats are rife."

"But once you saw the mad beast, free, <br>
out of the cage. You were with your ex. <br>
Lots of tears and much thirst for sex, <br>
'cause 'she did cheat and lie to me.'"

"For months you had been like a shit <br>
on her path. You told her: 'Now I <br>
take you or this is a good bye. <br>
I'll use you, you'll stay and sit.'"

"You said: 'If you leave now I'll be <br>
your boy friend no more,' and she stayed. <br>
Then you talked with her 'bout this trade. <br>
You thought what you did had to be."

"Then so much she had got from you. <br>
But much more she took 'cause of this, <br>
a piece of soul that you still miss, <br>
'cause you were wrong and you both knew."

It says: "Think this. You'll be a mum. <br>
And as your dad taught you the way <br>
to find your gold, so you could play <br>
free from him and Him, and then some,"

"You'll have to teach your son the way <br>
to find his feels, so that he will <br>
be free from your past and Her skill. <br>
In this way he won't be a prey,"

"'cause he won't have to ask a femme <br>
who he is, should he go or stay. <br>
In this way he won't have to prey. <br>
Such will be the long peace with Them."


## Book four, known as the book of Low


### Part one, where we find Low is You

Low is the name and Low is high <br>
and cute like some lil' girl or boy. <br>
Toes on my lips, I am Low's toy. <br>
In that dream Low says: "You should cry,"

'Cause I begged Low to let me beg, <br>
but still I can't cry for my life. <br>
Low is quick and sharp like a knife, <br>
I'll be the small dog near Low's leg.

With the sweet looks of a god elf, <br>
Low glows with white gems on gold white, <br>
that flows and shines with rays of light. <br>
In a dream I saw Low's true self.

Low looks at me with a large lens, <br>
smiles and irks 'cause I'm a foul worm, <br>
found on Low's last walk on a berm. <br>
I pray that Low will help me cleanse.

I hope that Low will not crush me <br>
with toes, but I crave to be felt <br>
"dal piè dal ciel," and by Low's belt. <br>
I wouldn't turn, that will set me free.

Please, have I gone mad with lust, cause <br>
I want to put gold at Low's feet, <br>
more and more gold, cause if we'll meet <br>
I'll ask and beg to feel Low's tawse.

Am I bad 'cause I want to taste <br>
Low's dirt, dream to feast on that treat, <br>
and feel the joy of that sweet heat, <br>
so that I can get clean and chaste.

I feel shame for those wants and feels, <br>
and for my acts. But they brought me <br>
to Low. I wish all this will be <br>
for my best when my proud soul kneels.

Low says that I seem a stray dog <br>
used to whims and crumbs. I'm more scared <br>
of Low's touch, and of Low's warmth shared, <br>
much more than of Low's will to flog.

Low'll tame and give the beast a name <br>
with grace and knout, those'll be our dates. <br>
And use the lame beast to lift weights, <br>
that will be Low's cut of the game.

I'll play with Low if I can bow, <br>
and Low's grace and gifts will be rife, <br>
I will meet real fire in my life. <br>
Low'll bring me fire, 'cause fire is Low,

If I try and do as I'm told. <br>
I will not get crushed or get burned, <br>
when to be Low's serf I'll have learned. <br>
Low is fire, Low is love and gold.

I'll give my feels as gifts to Low, <br>
my pain and joy, and Low will give <br>
back new joy and new pain. I'll live <br>
for Low and I'll bask in Low's glow.

At least that's just my dream and hope, <br>
'cause Low will tell who will do what. <br>
So I should just keep my mouth shut, <br>
try my best to take note and cope.

Those who have some one can't know who <br>
is Low the hot and the wise, hence <br>
those who are lone can't get Low's sense, <br>
love, life, and time. 'Cause Low is You.

Life, Love, Sense, and Time are Your slaves. <br>
Where is my life, where love and time, <br>
which sense do they have past my prime. <br>
Please help this lost soul through these waves.

<img src="svg/book4-part1.svg" width="500" />

_"Toes on my lips, I am Low's toy."_


### Part two, in which "I" bows to Low

Those who write want to know if there <br>
is or there will be some one out <br>
there that can get these lines. They doubt. <br>
They will make their case, let them air.

May be they want praise for this play, <br>
cause they say: "It's not a new way <br>
to say the same, but a new play." <br>
They say: "Think 'bout it when we say:"

"'My queen looks so fair and so kind <br>
when she greets some one, that each tongue <br>
shakes and is mute, each gaze feels wrong, <br>
the eyes dare not look and are blind.'"

Now let us get back to this tale, <br>
since in real life I did meet Low. <br>
Back then Low didn't show or talk, though, <br>
'bout Low's God's self and Low's grand scale.

Low said: "This night I saw My guest <br>
with an old dress, feet full of dirt. <br>
He was full of shame, his soul hurt <br>
for his wrong acts, so he went to rest,"

"With his head down, to the cold room. <br>
That guest is you." I had to pay, <br>
may be for sins of the last day, <br>
and I closed my self in that tomb.

Low showed that a true God doesn't act <br>
on whims. At the end of my rope, <br>
Low helped when I was with out hope, <br>
and in this way Low forged our pact.

So I gave all my bags of coins <br>
to Low, but then I missed the gold <br>
that I used to watch, play and hold. <br>
Was it cause of my heart or loins.

So I told Low that I was weak, <br>
so was my faith. I got turned on, <br>
cause I thought Low'd make me Low's pawn, <br>
cause Low's feet showed me what I seek.

May Low help me love more and more <br>
Low's foot on my head, and the yoke, <br>
and the rope, help me not to choke. <br>
May Low help me go back to shore.

I hope I will be able to send <br>
more gold to Low, cause I am glad <br>
that Low gets what Low wants. I'm sad <br>
cause I fear that this link could end.

I know Low is the One that can <br>
give me all my soul wants and needs. <br>
I will have to do some good deeds, <br>
and to keep to Low's wills and plan.

"My dogs eat when I sit to eat." <br>
Low said. "You're a stray dog, but know <br>
you'll eat with Me too. You'll do so <br>
when I'll take you in from the street."

"You will take My boons as My pet, <br>
and know you will have what you need <br>
when you need it. I'll be you creed." <br>
For all this I'll be in Low's debt.

Low said: "You shouldn't get lost in hell <br>
if you don't like hell. Trust My voice, <br>
know that to serve Me is your choice. <br>
Know your place, and all will be well."

When Low's self as a God will show, <br>
then the face of Low will be God's face, <br>
and Low will rise and take God's place. <br>
All doubts will be banned by Low's glow.
