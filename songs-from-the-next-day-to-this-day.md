# Songs from the next day to this day


## Book one, in which we first meet Them


### Part one, in which "I" tells the facts

Now I have to tell that one thing, <br>
and show how it all starts and still <br>
I beg for your sparkle and your skill. <br>
This tale, let me know how to sing.

That was the place, or so it seems. <br>
"Look there, you shall find the last cause. <br>
There you shall read what is, what was, <br>
what will be. You shall see their dreams."

I sat, eyes closed, my breath took me, <br>
and my face went in to the light, <br>
my face was lost in to the white. <br>
In awe I asked how it could be.

I left my breath, my skin, my eyes. <br>
I still had my legs and my arms. <br>
Then I felt their souls and their harms, <br>
and, lone on the Earth, I was wise.

Since those facts a few years have passed, <br>
since then I have tried to find why. <br>
I have gone lone, stopped to go high, <br>
lone talked, in fact the list is vast.

When I tried to make its bark cease <br>
the mad dog brought me to the East. <br>
I hate this self of mine, this beast <br>
that lurks and gives me no peace.

At night I would sit with my cheek <br>
on my fist. I would wait for you, <br>
one day they will do the same too. <br>
From me the kind love of the weak.

If I look back and think the way, <br>
I see that I have been in search <br>
of you, still am. Left in the lurch, <br>
I ask what was that made me stray.

It was that land or sea, that soul, <br>
where I saw you smile, where I saw <br>
a kid with your eyes and his awe. <br>
There a girl with your hands that stole

Thoughts, fast as the throw of a dart, <br>
men with your smile that let me rest. <br>
And each time I slept on the chest <br>
of the night, 'cause she had your heart.

And I know it was you that girl <br>
on sale, to whom I once told all <br>
this tale, while she looked at my fall. <br>
"Hear if you want," she held her pearl,

"Thoughts will rise, void words from a dark <br>
place where they live, they'll make you fight. <br>
Lift the cloth and they'll see the light, <br>
like flies from meat you'll see them spark."

The little girl winked in her heeled shoes, <br>
and smiled from the back of a guy. <br>
Soon I had to wish them good bye, <br>
so soon they went. I had no clues.

While I look at the world, I hope <br>
that you are here. When I will find <br>
you, and feel your touch on my mind, <br>
I will no more go down that slope,

Where in search of you I did choke. <br>
With you I will have back my breath. <br>
Or I will not find you and death <br>
will be here now with her black cloak,

The dark night with no stars nor skies. <br>
I will watch her face and not yours, <br>
I will kiss her lips and not yours, <br>
and I will see you in her eyes.

_"My face was lost in to the white."_



### Part two, in which She first calls me

It had to be in long lost dreams <br>
that She first called me from my bed. <br>
Then Her voice was first in my head <br>
and cut that thick fog at the seams.

That night She was a new born child, <br>
light, soft, and in Her eyes a shine. <br>
I hugged Her as if She were mine, <br>
I held Her in my arms, She smiled.

In the midst of light and dark thoughts, <br>
of sleep and wake, I heard Her voice. <br>
She told me that I was Her choice, <br>
She asked me to tie those bags' knots.

Who was She, this bolt from the sky, <br>
this cute bird in a nest of swords. <br>
"If you can say it in mere words, <br>
when you want to, then it's a lie."

She laughed at Her joke, while She played <br>
on the floor with my gold and stones. <br>
Her game gave me chills in the bones: <br>
maps of moods and feels She had made.

Once She was a doll with black hair, <br>
She was made of red blue green gum. <br>
She was not a friend, from my thumb <br>
She stole the ring, or was it fair.

Once She sent Her four slaves to trick, <br>
then the view was odd strange and fake, <br>
their punch left my paunch to ache. <br>
She a pale nymph or a simple chick.

For long I knew it was Her smile <br>
when She had gone back to Her place. <br>
She is a voice, She is a face, <br>
a thought, She is the queen of guile.

She is a feel, She is that song <br>
in your mind, She is that sweet fiddle. <br>
'Cause to me She is still a riddle, <br>
for Her I can't tell right from wrong.

What did She do to make me cringe, <br>
do what She asked, be with no wife, <br>
feel I would loose Her, tell my life. <br>
She did use my bod's urge to binge.

Like a full moon at noon She haunts: <br>
"Write. Each time you'll do it for Me <br>
and I'll have a new face for thee." <br>
She gives what She wants when She wants.

I want Her game and tell Her so. <br>
"Go up the hill, up stream the creek." <br>
She says. "It'll be yours on the peak." <br>
I pawn my ring and there I go.

Now She is in my dreams once more. <br>
There She cries for Her man has gone, <br>
and weeps on me, it must be dawn. <br>
Her rain hugs me, where is the shore.

This night She tells me what to write. <br>
This is Her tale, tale of Their lives. <br>
I feel shame while I tell these lies, <br>
'cause I feel I can't do it right.

In Her words: "Your lives are just dots, <br>
now you'll find the cause of this day <br>
in to the next day." "Who are They." <br>
"They are the key to clear those knots."

"Just as if They were you and I, <br>
ask who is you and who is I, <br>
what you wants, and the same for I. <br>
You knows what I means, so do I."

_"Once She sent Her four slaves to trick."_



### Part three, in which She and He meet

She rose. The cracks were heard for years, <br>
vast and mute She rose from Her soles, <br>
the Gods' gift, the ruin of the souls. <br>
There on Earth they weeped and shed tears.

The sky fell on Earth, it was night. <br>
Some didn't know what hit, all was blurred, <br>
and they were gone with out a word. <br>
There She was queen with out a fight.

He sat and asked and prayed and thought: <br>
"She is my drug, She is my light, <br>
She is my bug, She is my blight. <br>
Give Her the words." For Her He fought.

They called Him life, She called Him death. <br>
She broke His right heart with Her foot, <br>
but it's good that She had no boot. <br>
Now He could not bless nor have breath.

Then She moved Her hands in a dance: <br>
"No way to break the chain my friend, <br>
no one can win up at the end." <br>
She made Him drop that one last chance.

Her words closed the gates of His mind. <br>
Stuck in a rut, sand in the eyes, <br>
He looked at Her through stacks of skies. <br>
Her words had once more made him blind.

She told the four slaves where He was. <br>
She could craft their world with Her words, <br>
in that cage they were bound like birds. <br>
"You shall go and take with your jaws."

The imp said: "Please tell us the truth." <br>
"Good stuff floats, and the waste goes down <br>
to the place where you feed and frown," <br>
said the Queen that knows age and youth.

"Right where you did meet in the past, <br>
near the pink creek to the green lake." <br>
First was the dog, got next the snake, <br>
third was the man; the imp went last.

The imp was on Him first and took <br>
His prime mind and His prime first skin, <br>
'cause those were the keys to get in <br>
Her, how He could still feel and look.

"Now the man will eat you and go," <br>
Said the snake, yet He felt no fear. <br>
"Wait for one year, and still be here, <br>
the snake will stay, with sun or snow."

Said the man and they both bit Him. <br>
His first and last thought of the day, <br>
and His first and last breath till May, <br>
were in their jaws and He looked grim.

The dog took His last flesh and bones. <br>
"This is a test, you shall be Mine." <br>
Then to the slaves: "That's how you dine." <br>
And then She dressed Him in cold stones.

She told the dog to kiss Her feet, <br>
She told the snake to stroke Her leg, <br>
She told the man for Her to beg, <br>
She gave the imp Her dirt to eat.

There He was, proof of ruin and wrack. <br>
He faced the skies, and asked for more. <br>
So many stars and He saw a door, <br>
that door, and so He was healed back.

This tale was and once more will be, <br>
'cause Time is round and still goes round. <br>
Each turn is a stance of what's bound, <br>
our face whirls down in to that sea. <br>



<img src="svg/book1-part3.svg" width="500" />

_"Vast and mute She rose from Her soles."_



### Part four, in which we hear His rants

There on Mars, lots of strange men there. <br>
It's hard to hear: "Let's take a train," <br>
They watch me flip: "Let's leave this plain." <br>
They touch my lip. Where is the air.

He was born there, He was born right, <br>
yet They think that He is from space. <br>
He's like no one else in that place, <br>
and on all days He has the right.

He is a fool, and a mad man. <br>
He is so strange in His own place, <br>
so lone, He'll leave with out a trace <br>
when He'll cross the line of the ban.

"If He's at your door, give Him gold. <br>
His dad a tall old girl from Mars." <br>
That is what I learned in those bars <br>
late at night. That's what I was told.

So I did, and now I am beat. <br>
He walks with me in the red dirt, <br>
He grabs and pulls me by my shirt, <br>
He turns and we cross the street.

Each step a fall: "It's too much toil." <br>
I stop. "Hook Hers a butt o' death." <br>
"Who cares 'bout that" means His strange breath. <br>
"You My li'l beach I will not spoil."

Then He leaves me half way, with cars <br>
on both sides: "Guess how long to wait, <br>
run here or walk, judge at which rate. <br>
Or stay there and look at the stars."

He says: "Do not close that book yet, <br>
You have to love this film you live, <br>
that line from birth to death They give. <br>
You think you can still place your bet,"

"While you dream that there is a choice, <br>
while you dream that there is a deed. <br>
Calm peace of the world, that's your need." <br>
So that is the sound of His voice.

"Be mute and give your ear to Me. <br>
Some call it Fate. Some think they can <br>
choose how to play, they have a plan. <br>
Or choose the dealt hand, they've a key."

"Some know now what they should have done, <br>
and they soul is filled with that pain. <br>
In the same day they gloat in vain, <br>
death in their heart, they search for fun."

"In fact you know there's but one way, <br>
and you're in it, so in a sense <br>
it's your way, why to be so tense. <br>
Dance through the fog, how could you stray."

"I can tell that you will be more <br>
than you used to be at your peak, <br>
and you'll have eyes and hands that speak, <br>
when you'll know it's Us at your core."

Cars speed, then the roar of a truck. <br>
His voice on the noise, He's at ease. <br>
I stop Him and say: "Help me, please. <br>
How should I cross this road. I'm stuck."

"I don't know who 'I' has to be. <br>
I am no more the one I was. <br>
I was not who I thought I was." <br>
He says: "Sure, but now I've to pee."

Tick tack tick tack tick, who is It, <br>
tack tick tack tick, It is the one, <br>
tack tick tack, It is the lone sun, <br>
tick tack, that rose from the black pit.

_"He is a fool, and a mad man."_





## Book two, in which the next day shows



### Part one, in which we see a glimpse

What's in it for me, should I cease <br>
to write these songs or write them more. <br>
When my mind is lost in its war,  <br>
my next self sends a note of peace.

I can use it to find my way. <br>
Then there's the cost of a good deed, <br>
so I write it for all to read,  <br>
and see a glimpse of the next day.

I look in to the glass, at times, <br>
see some thing I didn't think I'd see, <br>
at once sense I knew there It'd be, <br>
and feel I've to tell that in rhymes.

That is the glass door of the soul, <br>
where all gods and sprites live and thrive. <br>
Those same that made me give and strive, <br>
those same that'll make me full and whole.

Please let all past forms and views pass. <br>
Please meet Them here. First light of dawn,  <br>
Their forms and Their views will be drawn. <br>
On this page the soul through the glass.

First we have to meet a new god. <br>
It hides so deep that we might take <br>
It for a sprite. Guess what's Its make. <br>
When we'll first see It, we'll be awed.

That is It. With a blond hair bob, <br>
It flaunts Its self in a pier glass, <br>
and with a smile It shows Its sass. <br>
It has such nice looks, a heart throb.

It says: "Thou art by cause of Them. <br>
They dream of thee. Thus thou wast sworn. <br>
Now They be here. Soon in the morn. <br>
When thou wake Them. Then thou be'st Them."

"You can't go to the gym next year. <br>
You can't make plans, or leave the strife, <br>
or change that thing, or change your life. <br>
Change your self and the world, my dear."

"You'll eat the head of a live snake, <br>
with bread, bit by bit. Feel the hate, <br>
bad taste, and fright, of such a plate. <br>
It will gross you out, but not break."

When It's here, It takes all the space. <br>
"Fais ce que tu doit que pour Moi, <br>
Parce que, en fait, Je suis ton roi." <br>
It's my king, I should ask for grace.

What It wants, can and must are one <br>
and the same thing, It has no laws. <br>
"I'm the kid you wish you had, 'cause <br>
your ex didn't want your girl or son."

It's in front of me in the glass, <br>
so I turn 'round and say to Them: <br>
"Look how nice I am, I'm a gem." <br>
It wears a wife's make up with class.

"Lei: è già qui, e Lui: è qua." <br>
It says: "Non è ciò che si fa, <br>
ciò che non è, ciò che non ha, <br>
ché il re del sud non ci sta."

He, She, and It show me the riddle, <br>
the crux, what it does mean and why, <br>
how to solve it. In fact I try, <br>
but it's hard to be in the middle.

They say: "One: good friend. Two: kind mate." <br>
Then: "Three: dear love." Please count past three, <br>
and add more terms to this list key. <br>
For Her: "Dog, snake, man." Then "imp" state.



<img src="svg/book2-part1.svg" width="500" />

_"You'll eat the head of a live snake."_



### Part two, in which She loves Him back

First, the ones that write these songs want <br>
to say a few words on the songs. <br>
Let them say this: "These are pop songs. <br>
One can get it now, with out taunt,

Or, well, get it on the next day. <br>
Feels from the streets, films and shows give <br>
the scent of pop, up through a sieve." <br>
Now let us go back to our play.

Now He and She are here each day. <br>
They are here more and more, by night <br>
and day, in the dreams that I write, <br>
in the streets, a face in my way.

Let's go to the hill of the dreams. <br>
If we look down in to the rocks, <br>
in the midst of all the stone blocks, <br>
there we will find some clean hot streams.

In to the hill rocks, from the Earth, <br>
Her wet stuff and His hot stuff force <br>
their way through the stones. From a source <br>
of pink broth, a creek has its birth.

It'll go to the lake, then the sea. <br>
There are pink hot tubs down the hill, <br>
they are there for the creek to fill. <br>
To this place She and He brought me.

From His mouth a long click click sound. <br>
He moved like a wave, in a dance. <br>
She was quiet and still, in a trance. <br>
He bate Her neck, Her bod He bound,

and held Her down with a soft squeak. <br>
He felt Her skin, She felt His kiss. <br>
His tail round Hers. Joined in a bliss, <br>
two skinks on a log near the creek.

He thought of Her, She thought of Him. <br>
At night in the house near the creek, <br>
She looked at Him, He touched Her cheek. <br>
She had black skin that shone, was slim.

I'm in awe while I look at Her <br>
trough His eyes and feel His feels. <br>
She smiled and took off Her white heels. <br>
She was so fine – I feel the stir

Of my heart – so cute, hot and kind, <br>
that She seemed to be from the sky.  <br>
He pulled Her close – I feel Her thigh. <br>
He held Her – A fire in my mind,

I feel with His hand Her light dress, <br>
and the thews of her arched back.  <br>
She kissed Him, as in a film, black <br>
and white, and then She just said: "Yes."

She wants me to hear Her love screams <br>
while She is with Him. Oh, how dear, <br>
how much gold it does cost to hear. <br>
That's how She and He haunt my dreams.

Out on the plain, of course, the rain, <br>
'cause She wished to merge with His heart. <br>
Now, that is too much on my part, <br>
the spice goes to my blood and brain,

I feel the end of life, the gloom <br>
of a fall in the void, and death. <br>
I think: "No." Now, I catch my breath, <br>
I'm out of Him, back to my tomb.

I ask to my self where It was. <br>
I know that It was there. It hides, <br>
lurks and stalks. It stays on the sides, <br>
in to the acts with out a cause.



<img src="svg/book2-part2.svg" width="500" />

_"He thought of Her, She thought of Him."_



### Part three, in which we see the World

Those that write want to be more in <br>
this tale, so let them say some thing: <br>
"You think you know how these words ring, <br>
the tongue of this script, you read with a grin."

"All this is for the eye that sees. <br>
So if we write: 'Oh my love, bye.' <br>
And next we add: 'My love bye bye.' <br>
If you are so kind to read, please,"

"Just look at the word length, look twice. <br>
If that is bad rhythm, then we doubt <br>
it is what you think. Here's the 'trout': <br>
The rhythm is from the Land of Rice."

Thus they want to make their first sale. <br>
Be that as it may, stop the spiel <br>
of those who write, they'll have their meal. <br>
We want to go on with our tale.

There is, on the back of the hill, <br>
a chasm that leads to a large pit: <br>
a huge hole in the ground, that's it. <br>
That day the air was cold and chill.

This hole in the ground is soft black, <br>
with brown and blue. I felt Its call <br>
to the depths, to the end less fall. <br>
There It was, a boy near the crack.

The boy said: "I rose from the hole," <br>
Its charms dared me to take a leap. <br>
I looked down in to the dark deep, <br>
to see the real shape of the soul,

And could not see the ground. I felt <br>
the pull of the void, saw Her, Him, <br>
and Them. They wished to know my whim, <br>
how I'd play the hand that was dealt,

If I could stand. They were 'round me  <br>
in a ring, They had turned Their backs.  <br>
The boy said: "Know what your mind lacks." <br>
"Your life is a ring, what will be"

"Is the cause of what is," It said. <br>
"On your soul They will leave a mark, <br>
then They'll fuck off back to the dark <br>
of the pit." Its voice in my head:

"If you now look at your In World, <br>
you think that there is an Out World, <br>
you think there are two worlds: In World, <br>
Out World. In fact it's the Same World."

"Call In World the cause of your feels, <br>
Out World the cause of what you sense. <br>
If you could just jump the fence, <br>
if you could just break the seals,"

"You think you would know those Worlds' laws. <br>
You look at a shade, and you make <br>
a source in your mind. That's a fake. <br>
Shades are but shades with out a cause."

"The Same World is but a pale shade, <br>
but a thin film that can't be seen <br>
by you. What you think is a screen, <br>
that is how the Same World is made."

"Now cut down the tale of the cave <br>
with an axe: you see, all in all, <br>
the World is the shade on the wall, <br>
with out cave, wall, sun, forms, or slave."

"In that World there is just one man, <br>
that man can have more than one face. <br>
With this in mind, look at that place: <br>
there is no end to what you can."



<img src="svg/book2-part3.svg" width="500" />

_"The boy said: 'I rose from the hole.'"_



### Part four, in which we meet the snake

Down the pink creek, past the green lake, <br>
near the sea, there's one of the towns. <br>
Full of dust and scents, folks and clowns, <br>
joy and pain, all for Her to take.

All that a soul may want or dread <br>
is there. She knows what a soul craves: <br>
in that town I can find Her slaves, <br>
and ask 'bout the lives they have led.

She had sent Her slaves to teach me <br>
when I first met them. They had showed <br>
in a fake world on a strange road. <br>
The dog held me, the snake punched me.

The girl friend from the sky was there. <br>
She showed a kind calm smile with ease, <br>
I saw Her and fell on my knees. <br>
Now, back where Her slaves say their prayer.

With its dumb smile and its strange hat, <br>
‘round that town I can meet the dog, <br>
called as well Sir Bitch or the hog. <br>
Now Sir Bitch thinks I’m Her floor mat.

Once I was on a bus with boys <br>
and girls from the land South of Laos. <br>
The bus stopped in front of a house, <br>
they went down with a lot of noise.

There I saw the snake, a round gnome, <br>
a nice old man with a short tail, <br>
a little hair on it, its skin pale. <br>
The snake took the stairs and went home.

To know 'bout the snake's life and task, <br>
I went to the door step and rang <br>
the bell. I heard its long loud clang. <br>
Snake let me in. I had to ask:

"Why Her." "I don't know, I'm Her slave. <br>
I know I like to think of Her <br>
that sits on my face and moves Her <br>
hips. Day and night that's what I crave."

"I am just a lewd bald fat guy, <br>
and I'd like to please my self in <br>
my back, with a toy made of tin, <br>
while on Her forms I'd try to spy."

"But here's the thing that makes me mad: <br>
I think the dog had more of Her <br>
than me. That's how it lost its fur. <br>
I’m too shrewd for the game She had."

The snake went on: “But now I’m skint.” <br>
Then: “It’s called Sir Bitch, has no grace. <br>
It drank Her broth, wants on its face, <br>
from Her source, if you got my hint.”

I had asked 'why' 'cause I know that's <br>
what all boys and girls want to know. <br>
That was a lot though, I thought: "Whoa, <br>
the snake did eat a lot of rats."

I know, I know, those who write <br>
want to say this: "What's this mind slough, <br>
why did we have to write this stuff. <br>
Why should we care 'bout their vile spite."

"Why did we have to ruin this tale. <br>
Please, talk some sense in to the snake,<br>
change those words, you know what's at stake."<br>
Now I have to end that sad wail.

That's Their tale, They tell where to look. <br>
How could I make sense of this stuff, <br>
or know why the tale got so rough. <br>
I hope They'll tell in the next book.


<img src="svg/book2-part4.svg" width="500" />

_"The snake took the stairs and went home."_





## Book three, in which we just chill out



### Part one, in which we have a chat


[...]

"I know you had ten years to fall, <br>
you lived in the past with out aim. <br>
And then ten years to mourn in shame, <br>
that was not a dance or a ball."

"You knew change isn't a piece of cake, <br>
it is not a walk in the park, <br>
a show of pomp. It is a dark <br>
path full of woe, it is a wake."

"Change of the world is a raw gore. <br>
You have to part from the old self, <br>
you can’t just put it on the shelf. <br>
That self is slain and is no more."

[...]

"Of course it was such a hard chore, <br>
and all folks know that, man, no doubt. <br>
But now you've got to chill out, <br>
you can't still be such a huge bore."

[...]

<img src="svg/book3-part1.svg" width="500" />

_"You can't still be such a huge bore."_



### Part two, in which we think of You

[...]

Once I met a cute girl for sale <br>
and she said: "I know you want me." <br>
I said: "With you, how could it be. <br>
Then I will want to lift your veil"

"And kiss you in front of the priest, <br>
and say: 'With you for all my life, <br>
I do want you to be my wife,' <br>
and dance with you at the feast."

[...]

She thought it was a joke, she laughed. <br>
"Babe, just for a small piece of gold <br>
